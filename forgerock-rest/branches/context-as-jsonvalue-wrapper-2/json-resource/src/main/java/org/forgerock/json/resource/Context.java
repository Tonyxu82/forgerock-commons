/**
 * The context associated with a request currently being processed by a JSON
 * resource provider. A request context can be used to query state information
 * about the request. Implementations may provide additional information,
 * time-stamp information, HTTP headers, etc. Contexts are linked together to
 * form a parent-child chain of context, whose root is a {@link RootContext}.
 * <p>
 * Contexts <b>MUST</b> support persistence by providing a <b>public</b>
 * constructor having the same declaration as
 * {@link #Context(JsonValue, PersistenceConfig)}.  See the method's
 * documentation for more details.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of the JSON representation of the core attributes of all
 * contexts:

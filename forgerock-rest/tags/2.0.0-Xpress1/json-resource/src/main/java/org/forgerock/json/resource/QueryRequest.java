/**
 * A request to search for all JSON resources matching a user specified set of
 * criteria.
 * <p>
 * There are four types of query request:
 * <ul>
 * <li>default query: when neither a filter, expression or query ID are
 * specified all resources will be returned
 * <li>query by filter: returns all resources which match the
 * {@link QueryFilter} specified using {@link #setQueryFilter(QueryFilter)}
 * <li>query by ID: returns all resources which match the named prepared query
 * specified using {@link #setQueryId(String)}
 * <li>query by expression: returns all resources which match a native
 * expression specified using {@link #setQueryExpression(String)}. Note that
 * this type of query should only be used in very rare cases since it introduces
 * a tight coupling between the application and the underlying JSON resource. In
 * addition, applications should take care to prevent users from directly
 * accessing this form of query for security reasons.

/**
 * A request handler which routes requests using URI template matching against
 * the request's resource name. Examples of valid URI templates include:
 *
 * <pre>
 * users
 * users/{userId}
 * users/{userId}/devices
 * users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}
 * </pre>
 *
 * Routes may be added and removed from a router as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * RequestHandler users = ...;
 * Router router = new Router();
 * Route r1 = router.addRoute(EQUALS, &quot;users&quot;, users);
 * Route r2 = router.addRoute(EQUALS, &quot;users/{userId}&quot;, users);
 *
 * // Deregister a route.
 * router.removeRoute(r1, r2);
 * </pre>
 *
 * A request handler receiving a routed request may access the associated
 * route's URI template variables via
 * {@link org.forgerock.http.RouterContext#getUriTemplateVariables()}. For example, a request
 * handler processing requests for the route users/{userId} may obtain the value
 * of {@code userId} as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * String userId = context.asContext(RouterContext.class).getUriTemplateVariables().get(&quot;userId&quot;);
 * </pre>
 *
 * During routing resource names are "relativized" by removing the leading path
 * components which matched the template. See the documentation for
 * {@link org.forgerock.http.RouterContext} for more information.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> for simplicity this implementation only supports a small sub-set
 * of the functionality described in RFC 6570.
 *
 * @see RouterContext
 * @see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570">RFC 6570 - URI Template</a>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the router.
 * @param <H> The type of the handler that will be used to handle routing requests.

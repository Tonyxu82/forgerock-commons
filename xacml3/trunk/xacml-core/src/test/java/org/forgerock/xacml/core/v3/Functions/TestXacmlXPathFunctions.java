/**
 * A.3.15 XPath-based functions
 This section specifies functions that take XPath expressions for arguments.  An XPath expression evaluates to a node-set, which is a set of XML nodes that match the expression.  A node or node-set is not in the formal data-type system of XACML.  All comparison or other operations on node-sets are performed in isolation of the particular function specified.  The context nodes and namespace mappings of the XPath expressions are defined by the XPath data-type, see section B.3.  The following functions are defined:

 urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:xpath-node-count
 This function SHALL take an “urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:data-type:xpathExpression” as an argument and evaluates to an “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer”.  The value returned from the function SHALL be the count of the nodes within the node-set that match the given XPath expression. If the <Content> element of the category to which the XPath expression applies to is not present in the request, this function SHALL return a value of zero.

 urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:xpath-node-equal
 This function SHALL take two “urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:data-type:xpathExpression” arguments and SHALL return an “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean”.  The function SHALL return "True" if any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the first argument equals any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the second argument. Two nodes are considered equal if they have the same identity. If the <Content> element of the category to which either XPath expression applies to is not present in the request, this function SHALL return a value of “False”.

 urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:xpath-node-match
 This function SHALL take two “urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:data-type:xpathExpression” arguments and SHALL return an “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean”. This function SHALL evaluate to "True" if one of the following two conditions is satisfied: (1) Any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the first argument is equal to any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the second argument; (2) any node below any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the first argument is equal to any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the second argument. Two nodes are considered equal if they have the same identity. If the <Content> element of the category to which either XPath expression applies to is not present in the request, this function SHALL return a value of “False”.
 NOTE: The first condition is equivalent to "xpath-node-equal", and guarantees that "xpath-node-equal"
 is a special case of "xpath-node-match".

/**
 * urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:xpath-node-match
 This function SHALL take two “urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:data-type:xpathExpression” arguments and
 SHALL return an “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean”.
 This function SHALL evaluate to "True" if one of the following two conditions is satisfied:
     (1) Any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the first argument is equal to any of the XML nodes in the
         node-set matched by the second argument;

     (2) any node below any of the XML nodes in the node-set matched by the first argument is equal to any of the XML
         nodes in the node-set matched by the second argument.

 Two nodes are considered equal if they have the same identity If the <Content> element of the category to
 which either XPath expression applies to is not present in the request, this function SHALL return a value of “False”.

 NOTE: The first condition is equivalent to "xpath-node-equal", and guarantees that "xpath-node-equal"
 is a special case of "xpath-node-match".

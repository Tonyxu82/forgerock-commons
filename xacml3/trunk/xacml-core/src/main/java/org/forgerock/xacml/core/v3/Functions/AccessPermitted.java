/**
 * A.3.16 Other functions
 urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:access-permitted
 This function SHALL take an “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI” and an
 "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" as arguments.

 The first argument SHALL be interpreted as an attribute category.
 The second argument SHALL be interpreted as the XML content of an <Attributes> element with Category
 equal to the first argument. The function evaluates to an "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean".
 This function SHALL return "True" if and only if the policy evaluation described below returns the value of "Permit".

 The following evaluation is described as if the context is actually instantiated,
 but it is only required that an equivalent result be obtained.

 The function SHALL construct a new context, by copying all the information from the current context,
 omitting any <Attributes> element with Category equal to the first argument.

 The second function argument SHALL be added to the context as the content of an <Attributes> element
 with Category equal to the first argument.

 The function SHALL invoke a complete policy evaluation using the newly constructed context.
 This evaluation SHALL be completely isolated from the evaluation which invoked the function,
 but shall use all current policies and combining algorithms, including any per request policies.

 The PDP SHALL detect any loop which may occur if successive evaluations invoke
 this function by counting the number of total invocations of any instance of this function during
 any single initial invocation of the PDP. If the total number of invocations exceeds the bound for such
 invocations, the initial invocation of this function evaluates to Indeterminate with a
 “urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:processing-error” status code.

 Also, see the security considerations in section 9.1.8.

/**
 * Represents the contract with a set of resources. 
 * 
 * The structure and depth of the (potentially nested) resource set it deals with is up to the implementation.
 * It can choose to just deal with one level, and hand off to another resource implementation, 
 * or it can choose to handle multiple levels. 
 * 
 * As an example, taking an id of level1/level2/leaf, 
 * and assuming that the resource implementation registers to handle level1 with the router;
 * the implementation could choose to hand off processing to other implementations for level2 (or leaf)
 * or it could handle all operations down to leaf.
 * 
 * Supports either synchronous or asynchronous internal processing, 
 * i.e. it does not have to block the request thread
 * until a response becomes available.
 * 
 * For synchronous internal processing, directly call setResult on the result handler in the method, e.g.
 * 
 * {@code out.setResult(id, rev);}
 * 
 * For asynchronous internal processing, either the reference to the result handler directly, 
 * or the callback id of the result handler can be used for a later call-back, 
 * potentially on a different thread, e.g.
 * 
 * {@code
 * String callbackId = out.getCallbackId();
 * <forward the request and return>
 * ...
 * CreateResultHandler.get(callbackId).setResult(id, rev);
 * }
 *
 * Asynchronous implementations must take care to eventually set a result 
 * or a failure on the result handler;
 * i.e. they must catch all exceptions and set a failure.

/**
 * Handles the result processing of update on a Resource.
 * 
 * Supports either synchronous or asynchronous internal processing, i.e. it does not have to block the request thread
 * until a response becomes available.
 * 
 * For synchronous internal processing, directly call setResult on the result handler in the create method, e.g.
 * 
 * {@code out.setResult(id, rev);}
 * 
 * For asynchronous internal processing, the callback id of the result handler can be used for a later call-back, 
 * potentially on a different thread, e.g.
 * 
 * String callbackId = out.getCallbackId();
 * <forward the request and return>
 * ...
 * CreateResultHandler.get(callbackId).setResult(id, rev);

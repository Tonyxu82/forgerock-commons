/**
 * Handles the result processing of operations on a Resource.
 * 
 * Result handler implementations support either synchronous or asynchronous 
 * internal processing, i.e. it does not have to block the request thread
 * until a response becomes available.
 * 
 * For synchronous internal processing, directly call setResult 
 * (exact signature for a given operation is specified by sub-types of this interface)
 * on the result handler in the method implementation, e.g.
 * 
 * {@code out.setResult(id, rev);}
 * 
 * For asynchronous internal processing, keep track of the result handler reference
 * which can be used for a later call-back, potentially on a different thread.
